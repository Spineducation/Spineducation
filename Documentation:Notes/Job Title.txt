Job Title 1
	Software Developer for iOS Augmented Reality Implementation 

Reports To  
	Dr. Anand
	Maya Ramamurthy
	Katrine Rachitsky
	Colby Oitment

Overview
	As it is imperitive for orthopedic surgeons to be able to perform surgery with a high level of precision, this role will focus on being able to provide medical school residents with higher level tools to be able to practise this skill set. Additionally, as residents are not able to get a lot of practise performing these complex surgeries, this will allow them a hands on means of being able to improve their precision and technical skills. In doing so, a medical school resident will be able to practise performing difficult procedures inside an augmented reality environment with a similar level of difficulty as actual procedures. This role will focus on the implementation of augmented reality for an orthopedic surgery studying app.

Overview
	After their completion of undergraduate training, medical students under go furthur training to be able to pass their Royal College Examinations. Only a fraction of medical students choose to pursue training related to orthopedics or neruosurgery, a component of the RCEs. As such, the spines remains a source of difficulty for many trainees, causing them to fail this section. Our project aims to provide learning from real clinical scenarios that will prepare doctors for the exams and also provide multiple choice questions.
